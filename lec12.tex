% ==================================================

\[
    R = \set{ \varphi(E) \mid \text{$E$ is a regular expression over $\set{0,1}$} }
\]

\[
    E \in \set{0,1,(,),\varnothing,*,+,\cdot}^*
\]
similarly, map each symbol to a binary string.

Is $R$ a regular language?

\begin{proof}
To prove that $R$ is not regular, we need to find a nonregular language $L$ so
$
L \reducable R
.$

Let
\[
    L = \set{ 0^n1^n \mid n\ge 0}
,\]
build the FST that translates from $L$ to $E$.

Thus proved that $R$ can be nonregular.
\end{proof}

$
\forall \varphi(E) \in R,
$
is $L(E)$ regular?

Yes. This question differs from the earlier one since the earlier question was about
$R$, the set of \emph{all} regexes. Language of every regex is a regular language, yet
that of the set of all regexes is not.

\subsection{Context Free Grammars}

\begin{definition}[Context Free Grammars]
    A context free grammar
    \begin{align*}
        G_L \colon S \mapsto \varepsilon \\
        S \mapsto 0S1
    \end{align*}
    Starting from symbol
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[]
    \[
        S \mapsto 0S1 \mapsto 00S11 \mapsto 00\varepsilon11 = 0011 \in L
    \]
\end{example}

\[
    L(G_L) = \set{ w \mid S \mapsto \cdots \mapsto w \in \Sigma^* }
\]

\begin{align*}
    G_R \colon  &S \mapsto \varnothing  \\
                &S \mapsto 0            \\
                &S \mapsto 1            \\
                &S \mapsto (S)          \\
                &S \mapsto S \cdot S    \\
                &S \mapsto S + S        \\
                &S \mapsto S^*
\end{align*}

With string ``$0+0\cdot0$,'' the expression can be treated as
%%% tree
but also
%%% tree
Thus we would like to adopt a set of grammar so the 

\begin{align*}
S \mapsto T \mid T + S  \\
T \mapsto F \mid F \cdot T  \\
F \mapsto F^* \mid 0 \mid 1 \mid (S) \mid \varnothing
\end{align*}
